                       Teh Ultimative Game, as they say!

                          http://thp.io/2011/octopi/


 Usage:

  1. You need a recent version of PS Move API:
     http://github.com/thp/psmoveapi

  2. You need your controllers paired with your PC:
     Use "psmovepair" from PS Move API for this (compile with hidapi support)

  3. You need the Move Daemon on your PC:
     Use "moved" from PS Move API for this (compile with moved support)

  4. Disable hid in bluetoothd by editing /etc/bluetooth/main.conf:
     Add "input" to the DisablePlugins list, e.g. DisablePlugins = input

  5. Restart Bluetoothd

  6. Start moved as root user or with the right permissions:
     sudo ./moved

  7. Press the PS button on each Move controller you want to use

  8. The output of moved should show the controllers as they connect

  9. Copy _psmove.so and psmove.py from the PS Move API build folder

 10. Start the game:

     python motion.py              # This runs the game in windowed mode
     python motion.py fullscreen   # This runs the game in fullscreen mode
